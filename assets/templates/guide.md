Step 1: Clarifying Questions
Prompt the LLM to ask insightful questions to deepen understanding:

What overarching goal or project are these tasks contributing toward?

Are there tasks that consistently remain incomplete? Why?

Is there an upcoming deadline or critical milestone?

Are any tasks ambiguous, overly broad, or poorly scoped?





Step 2: Analyze the Big Picture (Contextual Insight)
Prompt the LLM to synthesize context clearly:

Identify clusters or themes among tasks.

Point out gaps or redundancy in task sets.

Highlight potential misalignments with stated goals.



Step 3: Reorganization and Strategy
Prompt the LLM to suggest tactical task-grouping:

Recommend tasks for immediate action (to build momentum).

Suggest tasks that can be deferred, delegated, or removed.

Propose an optimal sequencing strategy.




Step 4: Identify Momentum Task
Prompt the LLM to pick a specific high-impact task:

Choose a single task offering significant immediate progress.

Clearly explain why this task is strategic for momentum.

Include actionable insights for successful completion.
